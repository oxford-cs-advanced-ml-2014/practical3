# Setup

Before you do anything else, run

```bash
conda update conda
```

and say yes to anything it asks you.

Check out the code from github by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oxford-cs-advanced-ml-2014/practical3.git
```

Then change into the practical3 directory and run 

```bash
./setup_environment.sh
```

to set up the environment for the practical.

# Bayesian Optimization (BO) with Expected Improvement.

The instructions for the practical are available on the course website.

Remember you need to use run.sh to run things.  For example, to run gp_demo.py you run

```bash
./run.sh gp_demo.py
```
